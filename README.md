# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION-OASIS-INFOBYTE
This project shows different visualization of the dataset. 

This repository contains code and resources for the classification of Iris flowers using machine learning techniques. The project focuses on building a model that can accurately classify different species of Iris flowers based on their petal and sepal measurements.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Iris dataset, which was introduced by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper. The dataset consists of measurements of 150 Iris flowers from three different species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. For each flower, four features are recorded: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The dataset is available in the data directory of this repository in the file named iris.csv. It is provided in CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, where each row represents a flower and the columns represent the features and labels.

Dependencies
The following dependencies are required to run the code:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the example notebook)

Acknowledgments
This project was inspired by the classic Iris flower dataset and serves as a learning resource for machine learning beginners. The code and documentation were developed with reference to various online tutorials and educational resources. Special thanks to Ronald Fisher for creating and sharing the Iris dataset, and to the open-source community for providing the necessary tools and libraries.
